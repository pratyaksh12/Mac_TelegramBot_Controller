# Mac_TelegramBot_Controller
Using telegram to connect your phone to your macbook. Do some stuff like take a photo of the user who is using the macbook, screen record. Turn it on or off. Basically a remote for your computer. Good for spying on suspicious people using your computer of if you are super padantic.
